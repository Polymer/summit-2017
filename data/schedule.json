How do we make elements that are “fast by default”, that don’t incur any unneeded cost, and that are easy to maintain and create? Using Polymer 2.0 and ES modules as a base, we’ll show you some of the awesome tricks the team has been cooking to help you make better elements."

Decoupled and the headless CMSes have emerged and are looking to address these issues - but what about componentized content? Can web components help us make a better content experience? This talk will look at the current state of content management, and how we can utilize web components. We'll look at creating a component to view and edit content, including design considerations, pitfalls, and what a future of content-based components could look like."

How do you organize and document a coherent ecosystem of modules that truly work well together, and how do you build an effective team to build them? The USA TODAY NETWORK design-dev team will share some of their lessons-learned from the past year spent overhauling their web framework."

        "speaker": "Chad Killingsworth, Jack Henry and Associates",
        "desc": "Introducing shared web components into disparate projects is a development dream, but when the build systems are different you spend more time creating helper scripts than writing shippable code. Using WebPack you can easily add Polymer components to any project and leverage a vast ecosystem of plugins to tame even the gnarliest of builds. As an added bonus your Polymer components can import content from node_modules without breaking a sweat."

        "desc": "If you're a mid to large size company, building your UI in Web Components and sharing it across teams on different stacks sounds like a great plan. In theory things should \"just work,\" but reality often proves otherwise. What do we need to do to make sure our components work well with all of the major frameworks and conversely what do the frameworks need to do to work with our components? This talk explores both sides of the problem and lays out some best practices that both parties can use to ensure seamless interoperability."

        "speaker": "Alex Russell, Google",
        "desc": "When we started the project that developed Web Components back in '11, the full impact of the mobile revolution hadn't yet been felt. Many tools and frameworks developed in the intervening years inherited desktop-centric assumptions that no longer make sense. What's needed now are approaches that let us build on-time and under budget -- both the development time and performance budget. Web Components were designed to help solve problems we understood from the desktop era, but mobile has pushed us to the limits of our ability and understanding. Do those problems still matter?"

This talk explores the challenges faced and lessons learned as the Ionic Framework team ported over their collection of mobile-first UI components from a traditional frontend framework to standard Web Components, all in pursuit of faster, more accessible mobile web apps. They will also unveil a new OSS project they created in the process that will help other teams get the most out of Web Components."

This talk provides a 30,000-foot view of what it means to make your PWA search- and social-ready in the age of web components, setting the stage for Sam and Trey’s deep-dives."

        "desc": "Working with client-based web technologies offers the promise of decoupling models and views. It’s a powerful model which yields a clean developer experience allowing the server to deal with data and interactions and the client UI to simply present and facilitate these interactions. SEO is the big problem these client-based technologies face. Building a headless Chrome service for rendering helps solve SEO & sharing problems while maintaining clean server code."

        "desc": "SSR - or server-side rendering - has become all the rage in other JavaScript communities and is a criticism of web components as something you cannot do. Trey is here to bust that myth providing an overview of the benefits, the hurdles to overcome, an in-depth look at how it's achievable and the challenges that are faced on the road ahead."

In this talk, you will learn how we use Polymer in research and education to experiment with applications that combine multiple devices. We will introduce our cross-device library that was built with Polymer and demonstrate how it can be used to create a simple webcam viewer for a large screen and phones. Students at ETH Zurich have used the library for various projects (including Bachelor and Master theses) and had quickly been able to create applications with the Web Components it provides."

We will see what goes into WebGL and how we can lay out the architecture to allow authors to create 3D applications from a set of small components. You will learn more about 3D rendering as well as component architecture."

        "desc": "ES6 Modules are now supported in all major modern browsers. By using the platform and building native, well-supported, modular code, you can benefit from speedier engineering cycles—no compile steps required during development. Sam will detail architectural patterns that enable you to use ES6 Modules for your webapp or experience, regardless of framework—including shipping modern code to modern browsers (fast!) while still compiling down to an older baseline for the long tail."
